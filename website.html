			Being vegan is more than just a diet that excludes animal products. Being
			vegan means making kind choices to fight against animal cruelty, saving
			the environment, and becoming your healthiest self with a plant based
			diet.Every choice we make matters. Leaving meat and dairy off your plate
			can save hundreds of animals. Purchasing products that are cruelty free
		  also saves lives and helps support companies that want to make a postive
			change in this world. As a benefit of being vegan, we get all our vitamins
			and minerals needed from plants that omnivorers often do not. Being vegan
			saves lives and promotes health. After 10 months of being vegetarian I
			decided to to follow a vegan diet and it was easier than I thought it
			would be. A year ago I ate chicken all the time and loved adding cheese to
			anything. When I actually started thinking about where my food came from
			and how the animals were treated, I realized that this is not something I
			want to support. It is so easy to forget at a restautant where our food
			came from and the life the animal lived before landing on our plate.
			Making small changes to your diet and being mindul about our choices makes
			all the difference.
